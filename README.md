# Canonn R&D Tools

This is a mono repo containing all of the tools used on the [Canonn Tools Site](https://tools.canonn.tech).

It is based on the following archived Repos:

## Codex-Router

- [Current Site](https://tools.canonn.tech/codexrouter/)
- [Previous Repo](https://github.com/canonn-science/Codex-Router)
- [Codebase](./tools/codexrouter)

This will find codex entries within jump range of two systems. Its used to plot a route for the Gnosis. Typically you would choose two systems approximately 1000Ly apart and the tool will find a system between them that has anything of interest

## Link Decoder (Aurvandil)

- [Current Site](https://tools.canonn.tech/linkdecoder/)
- [Previous Repo](https://github.com/canonn-science/Aurvandil)
- [Codebase](./tools/linkdecoder)

Thargoid Link Decoder

This is a replacement for the link decoder at [jubjubnest](http://jubjubnest.net:8001/?origin=hip+21251&data=hhl+hlh+llh+lhl+%2F+lll+llh+lhh%0D%0Ahlh+hll+lll+%2F+hhl+lll+lhl+%0D%0Ahhl+lll+hhl+%2F+hhl+lll+lhl+)

The web page calls a google serverless function that does the decoding and returns javascript. The javascript is parsed and displayed on the page.

It's not pretty but its functional

## Signals

- [Current Site](https://tools.canonn.tech/signals/)
- [Previous Repo](https://github.com/canonn-science/Signals)
- [Codebase](./tools/signals)

A web page to display signal data captured by the EDMC-Canonn plugin

## Thargoid Glyphs (Valknut)

- [Current Site](https://tools.canonn.tech/thargoid_glyphs)
- [Previous Repo](https://github.com/canonn-science/Valknut)
- [Codebase](./tools/thargoid_glyphs)

Select the Inner Ring component, and then choose the corresponding Outer Ring component to step through all the various combinations until you get the mix you want. 

Copy from the Image field to paste a direct link to the chosen combination wherever you want to refer to and display that glyph combination, on the forums or in a Discord chat.
